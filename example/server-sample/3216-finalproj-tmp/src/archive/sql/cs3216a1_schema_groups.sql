Founding members were a mix bag from all walks of life – Raymond and Jude were working full-time; East was in National Service; Troy from Sydney was modeling; Ivan, Fabian, and Leonardo all students. Along with Zouk’s resident DJ Aldrin, Radikal Forze spearheaded the scene, and took the dance to an unsuspecting local audience. \n\nA year later, the crew recruited 2 younger and very promising boys – Felix Huang and Farhan, and together, the Forze caught the attention of the media and event companies, and a string of shows started pouring in, propelling the crew into the limelight. \n\nAs the b-boy culture started growing rapidly in Singapore, Radikal Forze had to up their game to maintain their presence, hence a 3rd generation of younger b-boys was needed to keep the team tight and fresh. Mahmud, Afuq, and the brothers, Boy and Faiz, were taken into the family. Joining the team briefly was also veteran b-boy Mohd Hata, widely known to many as “Abang Hata”, who was part of the same crew - DBX Audiophile Breakers - as Aldrin back in the 80s! Completing the arsenal of a mix of new and old school, the team remained a force to be reckoned with. \n\nIn 2006 and 2008, Radikal Forze extended it’s arms to recruit more members. The 4th generations Tosh, Nic, Dom & Dehui, 5th generations Oneski and Wan, and international members B-boy Mouse from UK, and B-boy Nauty1 & B-boy Bogus from Seoul Korea.\n\nin 2007, Radikal Forze was also honoured to have the tradition of having an official DJ for a bboy crew come to light, as DJ Koflow joined the crew as the official DJ.\n\nThe current 14-man strong Radikal Forze will continue to storm through every competition, every b-boy battle, every b-boy jam, and make the presence of Radikal Forze felt and remembered.',48878799418),(410,'CS3216','This is the official FB Group for CS3216: Software Development on Evolving Platforms.',216503318372716),(411,'GlennWin SUAD 2014','Like all things human, love and passion, LIVES, CHANGES and DIES with time.

Beginner as well as advanced classes are conducted by the Dance Captain, or by a member instructor appointed by the Dance Captain.

Founding members were a mix bag from all walks of life – Raymond and Jude were working full-time; East was in National Service; Troy from Sydney was modeling; Ivan, Fabian, and Leonardo all students. Along with Zouk’s resident DJ Aldrin, Radikal Forze spearheaded the scene, and took the dance to an unsuspecting local audience. \n\nA year later, the crew recruited 2 younger and very promising boys – Felix Huang and Farhan, and together, the Forze caught the attention of the media and event companies, and a string of shows started pouring in, propelling the crew into the limelight. \n\nAs the b-boy culture started growing rapidly in Singapore, Radikal Forze had to up their game to maintain their presence, hence a 3rd generation of younger b-boys was needed to keep the team tight and fresh. Mahmud, Afuq, and the brothers, Boy and Faiz, were taken into the family. Joining the team briefly was also veteran b-boy Mohd Hata, widely known to many as “Abang Hata”, who was part of the same crew - DBX Audiophile Breakers - as Aldrin back in the 80s! Completing the arsenal of a mix of new and old school, the team remained a force to be reckoned with. \n\nIn 2006 and 2008, Radikal Forze extended it’s arms to recruit more members. The 4th generations Tosh, Nic, Dom & Dehui, 5th generations Oneski and Wan, and international members B-boy Mouse from UK, and B-boy Nauty1 & B-boy Bogus from Seoul Korea.\n\nin 2007, Radikal Forze was also honoured to have the tradition of having an official DJ for a bboy crew come to light, as DJ Koflow joined the crew as the official DJ.\n\nThe current 14-man strong Radikal Forze will continue to storm through every competition, every b-boy battle, every b-boy jam, and make the presence of Radikal Forze felt and remembered.',48878799418);
